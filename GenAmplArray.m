function [AmplitudeArray] = GenAmplArray(NuTargetIndex,TargetEffAmpl,nuBinsNumber)
% This function computes at each time instant an array of simulated
% swerling 0 target amplitudes according to the scenario.
% INPUT VARIABLES
% NuTargetIndex:    Row vector containing the angular bins of the present target    
% TargetEffAmpl:    Row vector containing the associated effective
%                   amplitude, i.e. the square root of the power
% nuBinsNumber:     Number of bins of the Î½ array
% OUTPUT VARIABLE
% AmplitudeArray:   Column vector containing nuBinsNumber element that are
%                   the amplitudes of the target in the bins with index
%                   NuTargetIndex and 0 in the bins where there is no
%                   target

TargetNumber=length(NuTargetIndex);
AmplitudeArray=zeros(nuBinsNumber,1);
if TargetNumber~=0
    AmplitudeArray(NuTargetIndex)=reshape(TargetEffAmpl,TargetNumber,1).*exp(1i*2*pi*rand(TargetNumber,1));
